# Patient-Portal-Evaluation
The file in this repository consists of qualitative analysis of the newly implemented Patient Portal at EHCH. Based on the feedback obtained from the users (patients)
there were some difficulties faced in the full adoption of the application from the users side. Therefore, this evaluation study was performed to investigate which aspect
of the patient portal needs to be changed/improved.
